#Testing with Codeception:

This section shows some tests with Codeception, like Unit, Functional and Acceptance tests.

## 1. Getting started:
To run all your test suites with Codeception you can use the next command 
(depends on how you installed Codeception, by Composer or by using the .phar file):

```bash
php codecept.phar run --steps
```
Or 
```bash
php vendor/bin/codecept run --steps
```

You can also generate HTML report by adding --html argument:
```bash
php codecept.phar run --steps --html
```

As well as generating JUnit XML reports by adding --xml argument:
```bash
php codecept.phar run --steps --xml
```

## 2. Acceptance Tests:
Acceptance test could be defined differently from context to other, but we are here talking
about web context, so an acceptance test is a test which tests the functional part of a user
story and checks all the iterations of that story in order to give a green flag and accept it.

Codeception, as mentioned, provides the necessary environment to start write your acceptance tests.
You can check ***tests/acceptance*** folder to have an idea about these kind of tests.

### FYI: What are regression tests:
According to Wikipedia, regression tests is the action of re-running all the functional 
and non-functional tests after any change, to check if everything is working fine as it 
is supposed to be.

## 3. Functional Tests:
Functional tests are similar to acceptance tests, except that a functional test doesn't require 
a web server.
